# Mininet-Project
SUMO Polban Highway - work!  
try it by open the polban1.sumo on your sumo!  
  

Mininet - on progress..  
Cant use my sumo map because errno 111, still searching for the solution!
beside that, it still use the "new-york map" even after i change the xml files source inside the map.sumocfg (example program)  
So far the change i made from vanet-sumo.py is the vehicle intensity (its generated by SUMO file) and the number of AP + its position
